    abstract  ="Recently{,} indoor photovoltaics have gained research attention due to their potential applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) sector and most of the devices in modern technology are controlled via wireless/or battery-less means and powered by indoor photovoltaics. This review provides an overview of the developments of thin film solar cells{,} particularly solution-processed dye-sensitized solar cells{,} organic solar cells{,} quantum dot solar cells{,} and upcoming organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells for indoor applications. Further{,} a comprehensive material assessment{,} device design{,} and indoor lighting characteristics are discussed. We also highlight the challenges and prospects for the development of indoor photovoltaics for various IoT applications."
